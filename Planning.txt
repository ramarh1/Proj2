PLANNING FILE FOR JAVA PROJECT 2
Plan expectations:

- Class Hierarchy with arrows denoting relationships (minimum of 3 classes). Must have IS-A relationship and should have HAS-A relationship

- Consider whether or not an interface is useful for your program (NOT USEFUL)

- UML diagram of each class

- Pseudocode for a user facing console program 










Project expectations:

- All files organized in a project folder

- All classes written and tested in isolation

- Classes will have constructors, getters and setters as needed, a toString() method and other methods as needed. (Non-Driver Classes DO NOT use Scanner. Your Main/Driver can use Scanner)

- The client program must have a reasonable and friendly interface for the user

- The project must include a collection of objects such as an array or an ArrayList<>

- The project must make use of polymorphism

- The user must be able to affect the program while its running (input data and/or menu choices)

- The program must validate user input

- The program must produce output

- The program must include user friendly error messages (TRY/EXCEPT HANDLING)
